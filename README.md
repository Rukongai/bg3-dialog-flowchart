# BG3 Dialog Flowchart

Forked off of Akintos's amazing work. Mutilating and sinning against their code to try and create a tool that can parse lsj directly from unpacked game paks.

# To Do
- Additional highlighting of flags, tags, and dialog flow stuff
- Convert existing json data types and references to use the more ugly, but more accessible game LSJ
- Ability to upload dialog LSJ instead of relying on online repo
- Play audio from users unpacked files
- Scan for updated lsj in Patch paks and quick swap between versions
- Dialog file tree browsing
- Keyword search
